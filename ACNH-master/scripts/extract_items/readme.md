# Requirements
I wrote this with Python 3.8.5 for testing, other versions of Python 3 should also work though.  
The following packages are required to run the program:  
- sarc
- zstandard
- zlib

# Important information
This script is in no way perfect. I originally wrote it just for myself and rewrote parts to make it easier to use and distribute so other people can also dump item IDs in the same format. Some parts are very ugly and hacky.  
If you want to improve this program to make it easier to read, feel free to open a pull request!

# How to run
```
python3 make_item_list.py
```

# Acknowledgements
`bcsv.py`, `build_specs.py` and `dump_all_bcsv.py` were make by Treeki over at https://github.com/Treeki/CylindricalEarth. I did not write those files.
